â€¢	Write a program that simulates a number guessing game.
o	The program should pick a random number between 1 and 10.
o	The user has five attempts to guess the number.
o	If the user guesses correctly, print "Congratulations! You guessed it right!".
o	If the guess is too high or too low, give a hint.
o	End the game early if the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
