"""
Write a program that takes in a students test score (out of 100) and returns their letter grade based on the following scale:
90-100=A
80-89=B
70-79=C
60-69=D
below 60 = F

Use a lambda function to validate whether a score is within the correct range (0-100). If the score is not valid, return "invalid Score"

"""

"""
1. Ask user to input their test score
2. use if and elif statements to define grade based on score
3. print grade
4. use lambda function to validate that score is within correct range
