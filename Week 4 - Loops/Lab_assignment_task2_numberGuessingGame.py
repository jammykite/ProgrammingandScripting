"""Write a program that simulates a number guessing game.

The program should pick a random number between 1 and 10.

The user has five attempts to guess the number.

If the user guesses correctly, print "Congratulations! You guessed it right!".

If the guess is too high or too low, give a hint.

End the game early if the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts."""
