Your second task is to build a chatbot for MoodSense, a company that offers mental wellness solutions.
You need to develop a chatbot that asks users to describe their mood on a scale of 1 to 10 and provides
an appropriate response based on their input.

The response flow should follow this logic:
•	1-3: “I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. Consider talking to a friend or taking some time for yourself.”

•	8-10: “That’s great to hear! Keep up the positive energy!”
